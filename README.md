# About this Project

This project is a simple React site that was created for teaching/demonstration purposes by Sarah Mac Neill.
I've been adding some changes.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running this project on your computer

Node package manager (npm) is used to manage this project's dependencies, and to build and run this React app. You'll need npm before you can do the next steps, [here's how to install it](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

To run this site locally (on your computer), navigate to the project directory in your terminal. From here you can run:

### `npm install`

This installs all the dependencies your project needs. Dependencies are libraries and modules created by other developers that this project utilises.

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console. (lint errors are inconsistencies with the formatting of your code)

## Deployment

[React docs on deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

## Other available scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
